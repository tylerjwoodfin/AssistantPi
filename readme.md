# Description

A node-based, device-agnostic virtual assistant run from your Raspberry Pi.

# Status
- This is in very early development and is prone to quick and significant changes. Pull at your own risk.

# Features
- Currently, this is mainly an experimental thing, but as I continue development, some things I'd like to see are:
	- Conversations (e.g. /ask)
	- Task management through cloud-based text files (e.g. /todo?shop=milk)
	- Integration with mail, calendar, IoT devices, etc.


# Usage: 
- node index.js to run
